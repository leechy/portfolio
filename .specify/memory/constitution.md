# Leechy.dev Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Simplicity

Code MUST prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness. Start with the simplest solution that works, avoid premature optimization, and prefer explicit over implicit behavior. Every abstraction MUST be justified by concrete need, not theoretical future requirements. When complexity is unavoidable, it MUST be isolated and well-documented.

**Rationale**: Simple code reduces bugs, accelerates development velocity, and enables team collaboration by making systems comprehensible to all contributors.

### II. In-Code Documentation

Code MUST be self-documenting through meaningful names, clear structure, and strategic inline comments. Function names MUST describe intent, variable names MUST reveal purpose, and complex algorithms MUST include explanatory comments. Public APIs MUST have comprehensive documentation with examples.

**Rationale**: Code is read far more than it's written. Self-documenting code reduces cognitive load, enables faster onboarding, and prevents knowledge silos.

### III. Testing Coverage (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All code MUST have comprehensive test coverage following Test-Driven Development (TDD). Tests MUST be written before implementation, must fail initially, then pass after correct implementation. Minimum 90% code coverage required with focus on critical paths, edge cases, and user workflows. Integration tests MUST validate cross-system behavior.

**Rationale**: Tests serve as executable specifications, enable fearless refactoring, catch regressions early, and provide confidence in system reliability.

### IV. User Experience Consistency

All user interfaces MUST provide consistent interaction patterns, predictable behavior, and clear feedback. Error messages MUST be actionable and user-friendly. Loading states, success confirmations, and failure handling MUST follow established patterns. APIs MUST maintain consistent naming conventions and response formats.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces user cognitive load, builds trust, improves adoption rates, and creates a professional, polished product experience.

### V. Performance Requirements

All features MUST define measurable performance targets and meet them consistently. Response times, throughput, memory usage, and resource consumption MUST be specified and validated. Performance regressions MUST be caught in CI/CD pipeline. Optimization work MUST be data-driven with before/after metrics.

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, system scalability, and operational costs. Proactive performance management prevents technical debt accumulation.

## Development Standards

Code reviews MUST verify compliance with all five core principles. New features MUST include performance benchmarks and UX consistency checks. Technical debt MUST be explicitly justified and tracked with remediation timelines.

## Quality Gates

All pull requests MUST pass automated tests, code coverage thresholds, performance benchmarks, and UX consistency validation. Manual testing MUST verify user experience flows before deployment.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require team approval, impact analysis, and migration plan. All development decisions MUST reference relevant constitutional principles for justification.
