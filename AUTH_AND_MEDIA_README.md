# Authentication & Media Management System

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the two essential admin system components you requested:

1. **Authentication System** - Secure login with token-based session management
2. **Media Upload & Management** - Complete file management interface

## üîê Authentication System

### Features

- **Secure Login**: Email/password authentication with proper validation
- **Session Management**: Token-based authentication with localStorage persistence
- **Route Protection**: Middleware to protect admin routes from unauthorized access
- **Auto-redirect**: Automatic redirects for authenticated/non-authenticated users
- **Loading States**: Proper loading and error handling throughout

### How It Works

#### 1. Authentication Flow

```
1. User visits /admin/* ‚Üí Check authentication
2. If not authenticated ‚Üí Redirect to /admin/login
3. User enters credentials ‚Üí Validate against stored credentials
4. If valid ‚Üí Generate token, store in localStorage, redirect to dashboard
5. If invalid ‚Üí Show error message
```

#### 2. Code Structure

**Authentication Module (`/src/lib/auth/auth.ts`)**:

- `authStore` - Svelte store for authentication state
- `login()` - Handle user login with credentials
- `logout()` - Clear authentication and redirect
- `initAuth()` - Initialize auth state from stored token
- Token generation and verification functions

**Route Protection (`/src/routes/admin/+layout.ts`)**:

- Checks authentication on all admin routes
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Skips check for login page itself

**Admin Layout (`/src/routes/admin/+layout.svelte`)**:

- Integrated navigation with user menu
- Logout functionality
- Loading states during auth initialization

#### 3. Usage

**Login Credentials (Demo)**:

- Email: `admin@leechy.dev`
- Password: `admin123`

**Testing Authentication**:

1. Visit http://localhost:5174/admin/login
2. Enter the demo credentials
3. You'll be redirected to the admin dashboard
4. Try accessing admin routes - they're now protected
5. Logout from the user menu to test the flow

### Security Features

- **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after 24 hours
- **Input Validation**: Proper email and password validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages (no credential leakage)
- **Route Protection**: All admin routes require authentication

## üìÅ Media Management System

### Features

- **File Upload**: Drag & drop or click to upload multiple files
- **File Types**: Support for images, videos, and documents
- **File Preview**: Image thumbnails, video previews, document icons
- **File Management**: View, download, delete files
- **Search & Filter**: Search by filename, filter by file type
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and delete multiple files
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### How It Works

#### 1. Upload Process

```
1. User drags files or clicks upload area
2. Files are added to upload queue
3. User can review and remove files from queue
4. Click "Upload Files" to process all files
5. Files are uploaded with progress indication
6. Files appear in the media library
```

#### 2. File Management

**Media Library Features**:

- Grid view of all uploaded files
- File previews with metadata (size, dimensions, upload date)
- Search functionality to find specific files
- Filter by file type (all, images, videos, documents)
- Select multiple files for bulk operations
- Individual file actions (preview, download)

**File Preview Modal**:

- Full-size preview for images
- Video player for video files
- Download option for documents
- File details and metadata

#### 3. Code Structure

**Media Page (`/src/routes/admin/media/+page.svelte`)**:

- Complete file upload interface
- Media library with grid layout
- File preview modal
- Search and filtering capabilities

**Key Components**:

- Upload area with drag & drop support
- File queue management
- Media grid with responsive design
- Preview modal for different file types
- File actions and bulk operations

### Usage Instructions

#### Uploading Files

1. Navigate to **Admin ‚Üí Media** from the admin dashboard
2. **Drag files** onto the upload area or **click to browse**
3. Files are added to the upload queue
4. Review the files and remove any unwanted ones
5. Click **"Upload Files"** to upload all queued files
6. Files will appear in the media library below

#### Managing Files

1. **Search**: Use the search box to find files by name
2. **Filter**: Select file type filter (All, Images, Videos, Documents)
3. **Preview**: Click on any file to open the preview modal
4. **Select**: Check the boxes to select multiple files
5. **Delete**: Use "Delete Selected" to remove files
6. **Download**: Click the download icon on any file

#### File Organization

- **Images**: Show as thumbnails with dimensions
- **Videos**: Display with play icon and duration
- **Documents**: Show with document icon
- **File Info**: Size, upload date, and dimensions (for images)

### Technical Implementation

#### File Storage (Current: Mock Implementation)

```javascript
// Current implementation uses mock data and URL.createObjectURL()
// For production, you would:

1. Upload files to cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
2. Store file metadata in database
3. Generate proper URLs for file access
4. Implement proper file validation and security
```

#### File Processing

- **Image Optimization**: Resize and compress images
- **Video Processing**: Generate thumbnails and metadata
- **File Validation**: Check file types, sizes, and security
- **CDN Integration**: Serve files through CDN for performance

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Test Authentication

```bash
# Server should be running on http://localhost:5174
# Visit: http://localhost:5174/admin/login
# Login with: admin@leechy.dev / admin123
```

### 2. Test Media Management

```bash
# After logging in, go to: http://localhost:5174/admin/media
# Try uploading some test files (images, videos, documents)
# Test the search, filter, and preview features
```

### 3. Integration Points

The system is fully integrated with:

- **Admin Dashboard**: Media management link in quick actions
- **Admin Navigation**: Media link in sidebar navigation
- **Authentication**: All routes are properly protected
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## üîß Production Considerations

### Authentication

1. **Secure Credentials**: Use database with hashed passwords
2. **JWT Implementation**: Replace simple tokens with proper JWT
3. **Session Management**: Add refresh tokens and proper expiration
4. **Multi-factor Auth**: Add 2FA for enhanced security
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks

### Media Management

1. **Cloud Storage**: Upload to AWS S3, Google Cloud, or similar
2. **File Processing**: Add image resizing, video transcoding
3. **CDN Integration**: Serve files through CDN
4. **File Validation**: Implement proper security scanning
5. **Database Integration**: Store file metadata properly
6. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups of uploaded files

### Performance

1. **Lazy Loading**: Load images on demand
2. **Pagination**: Handle large numbers of files
3. **Caching**: Cache file lists and metadata
4. **Compression**: Optimize file sizes automatically
5. **Progressive Loading**: Show thumbnails while loading full images

## üìù Summary

You now have both essential admin system components:

‚úÖ **Authentication System**:

- Secure login with credential validation
- Token-based session management
- Route protection middleware
- Proper loading and error states

‚úÖ **Media Upload & Management**:

- Complete file upload interface
- Media library with search and filtering
- File preview and management
- Responsive design for all devices

The system is fully functional and ready for testing. All admin routes are protected, and the media management system provides a complete solution for file handling in your portfolio admin interface.

Try logging in at http://localhost:5174/admin/login with the demo credentials, then explore the media management at http://localhost:5174/admin/media!
