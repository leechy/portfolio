# Feature Specification: Web Developer Portfolio Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-portfolio-website`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a web developer portfolio website. Home page should showcase my skills, current and recent projects, and contact information. The internals should be organized by projects, with each project having its own page detailing the technologies used, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and skills demonstrated. Additionally there will be a blog section for sharing insights and experiences."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Portfolio Homepage Overview (Priority: P1)

A potential employer or client visits the portfolio website to quickly assess the developer's skills and recent work. They need to see an overview of capabilities, featured projects, and how to make contact.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary entry point and first impression. Without an effective homepage, visitors won't explore further or understand the developer's value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the homepage and verifying all key information (skills, projects, contact) is visible and accessible within 10 seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they view the page, **Then** they see a clear overview of the developer's key skills
2. **Given** the visitor is on the homepage, **When** they scroll through the page, **Then** they see featured recent projects with brief descriptions
3. **Given** the visitor wants to contact the developer, **When** they look for contact information, **Then** they find easily accessible contact details or contact form

### User Story 2 - Project Deep Dive (Priority: P2)

A visitor wants to understand the depth of the developer's work by exploring detailed project information including technologies, challenges, and problem-solving approach.

**Why this priority**: This demonstrates technical depth and problem-solving skills, which are crucial for hiring decisions and client confidence.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking on any project from the homepage and viewing a complete project detail page with all required information.

### User Story 3 - Professional Blog Access (Priority: P3)

A visitor interested in the developer's thought process and ongoing learning wants to read blog posts about insights and experiences.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for demonstrating expertise and thought leadership, it's supplementary to the core portfolio functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the blog section and reading published posts about development insights and experiences.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor wants to read development insights, **When** they navigate to the blog section, **Then** they see a list of published blog posts
