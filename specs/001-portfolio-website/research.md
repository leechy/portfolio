# Research Document: Web Developer Portfolio Website

**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Feature**: Portfolio Website Implementation  
**Purpose**: Research technology decisions and best practices for SvelteKit portfolio implementation

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework: SvelteKit

**Decision**: Use SvelteKit for the web framework

**Rationale**:

- Built-in SSR/SSG capabilities for SEO and performance
- File-based routing simplifies project structure
- Excellent performance with small bundle sizes
- Strong TypeScript support for code quality
- Active ecosystem and good documentation

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Next.js: More complex setup, React ecosystem overhead
- Nuxt.js: Vue ecosystem, less familiar
- Astro: Good for static sites but less interactive features

### Database: SQLite

**Decision**: Use SQLite for content storage

**Rationale**:

- Lightweight, serverless database perfect for portfolio scale
- No additional infrastructure needed
- Excellent performance for read-heavy workloads
- Easy backup and deployment
- Built-in full-text search capabilities

**Alternatives Considered**:

- PostgreSQL: Overkill for portfolio scale, needs separate server
- MongoDB: Document database unnecessary for structured content
- File-based storage: Difficult to manage relationships between projects/skills

### Styling: Tailwind CSS

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling

**Rationale**:

- Utility-first approach aligns with constitution's simplicity principle
- Excellent dark theme support
- Built-in responsive design utilities
- Small production bundle sizes with purging
- Great accessibility features

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Vanilla CSS: More maintenance overhead for consistency
- Styled-components: Runtime overhead, less performant
- Bootstrap: Less customization, heavier default bundle

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layer testing with Vitest, Testing Library, and Playwright

**Rationale**:

- Vitest: Fast, Vite-native testing with excellent TypeScript support
- @testing-library/svelte: Component testing focused on user behavior
- Playwright: Reliable E2E testing with good debugging tools
- Covers all testing levels required by constitution

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Jest: Slower setup with Vite, extra configuration needed
- Cypress: Heavier, flakier than Playwright for E2E

## Content Management Strategy

### Project Data Storage

**Decision**: Store project metadata in SQLite, project content in Markdown files

**Rationale**:

- Database stores structured data (skills, technologies, relationships)
- Markdown files for rich content (descriptions, challenges, solutions)
- Easy to version control and edit
- Good separation of concerns

### Blog Post Management

**Decision**: Store blog posts in database with Markdown content

**Rationale**:

- Enables dynamic features (search, filtering, categories)
- Better performance for listing and pagination
- Supports metadata like publish dates, tags, drafts

### Image Handling

**Decision**: Use optimized static images with responsive loading

**Rationale**:

- Store images in `/static/images/` directory
- Use SvelteKit's built-in optimization
- Implement lazy loading for performance
- Support multiple formats (WebP, JPEG fallbacks)

## Performance Optimization

### Static Site Generation

**Decision**: Use SvelteKit's prerendering for static content

**Rationale**:

- Homepage, project pages, and blog posts can be pre-generated
- Faster initial page loads
- Better SEO performance
- Reduced server load

### Database Optimization

**Decision**: Implement connection pooling and query optimization

**Rationale**:

- Single SQLite connection with proper connection management
- Indexed queries for skill filtering and search
- Prepared statements for security and performance

## Deployment Strategy

### Hosting: DigitalOcean Droplet

**Decision**: Deploy to DigitalOcean Ubuntu droplet with Nginx

**Rationale**:

- Full control over server configuration
- Cost-effective for personal portfolio
- Easy to scale if needed
- Good performance for target audience

### CI/CD Pipeline

**Decision**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

**Rationale**:

- Automated testing before deployment
- Zero-downtime deployment with PM2
- Environment-specific builds
- Automated security scanning

### SSL and Security

**Decision**: Let's Encrypt SSL with security headers

**Rationale**:

- Free SSL certificates with auto-renewal
- Security headers for protection
- Regular security updates via automated scripts

## Accessibility Implementation

### Screen Reader Support

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive ARIA labels and semantic HTML

**Rationale**:

- Meets constitution's accessibility requirements
- Semantic HTML5 elements for structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for all images

### Keyboard Navigation

**Decision**: Full keyboard navigation support

**Rationale**:

- Tab order management
- Skip links for main content
- Focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Proper form labeling

## SEO Strategy

### Meta Information

**Decision**: Dynamic meta tags with Open Graph support

**Rationale**:

- Improved social media sharing
- Better search engine indexing
- Project-specific descriptions
- Blog post metadata

### Structured Data

**Decision**: Implement JSON-LD structured data

**Rationale**:

- Enhanced search results
- Professional portfolio schema
- Blog post structured data
- Contact information markup

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization

**Decision**: Feature-based component organization

**Rationale**:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Easy to test and maintain
- Follows SvelteKit best practices

### Version Control

**Decision**: Git flow with feature branches

**Rationale**:

- Clean commit history
- Feature isolation
- Easy rollbacks
- Code review workflow
