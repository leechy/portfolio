# Tasks: Web Developer Portfolio Website

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-portfolio-website/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution. All tests must be written FIRST and FAIL before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **SvelteKit project**: `src/` at repository root
- All paths shown assume SvelteKit structure from plan.md

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Contact & API (Phase 6)**: Can start after Foundational, runs parallel to user stories
- **Performance (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all previous phases

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (MANDATORY) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Database queries before components
- Components before pages
- Core functionality before integration features
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Database queries within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "E2E test for homepage loading in tests/e2e/homepage.spec.ts"
Task: "Integration test for skills data loading in tests/integration/skills.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for featured projects query in tests/integration/projects.test.ts"
Task: "Component test for SkillCard in tests/unit/SkillCard.test.ts"

# Launch all database work for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Skills model and queries in src/lib/database/queries.js"
Task: "Create Projects model and featured projects query in src/lib/database/queries.js"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 + Contact features
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3 + Performance optimization
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests MUST be written first and fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution requires 90%+ test coverage - comprehensive testing mandatory
- Performance targets: <3s load times, 90+ Lighthouse scores
- Accessibility target: 90%+ accessibility score for screen readers and keyboard navigation
